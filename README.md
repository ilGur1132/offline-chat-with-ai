Offline Chat with AI is an extension that enables you to chat with the built-in AI chatbot in your browser. 

In Chrome browser version 127+, the Gemini Nano is available as an offline AI engine. This extension allows you to chat with this AI agent in a very user-friendly interface. Before using the addon, please make sure to follow the below steps to enable the AI in your browser.

1. Install Chrome Canary (www.google.com/chrome/canary/) or any compatible Chromium-based browser (version 127+).  
2. Open "chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano", and set it to: Enabled  
3. Open "chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model" and set it to: Enabled BypassPerfRequirement  
4. Restart Chrome browser.  
5. Open "chrome://components/" and find the item "Optimization Guide On Device Model" and press the "Check for update" button.   

Note 1: If you do not see the "Optimization Guide On Device Model" in step 5, please disable the settings in steps 2 and 3, restart your browser, and re-enable them again.  
Note 2: Please ensure the device model in step 5 is fully downloaded or the status is Up-to-date before using the addon. The model is rather large (around 2GB) and may take a few minutes to download. So please be patient while it is being downloaded.

The app interface has a toolbar on the left side with a few buttons (self-explanatory with tooltips). Moreover, the interface for the extension can be opened in the toolbar popup, sidebar, separate window, or a new tab. Please right-click on the toolbar button to choose one.
